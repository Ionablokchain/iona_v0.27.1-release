## Formal Safety Properties (UPGRADE_SPEC.md §7)

| Property | Description | Verified By |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **S1: No Split Finality** | At most one finalized block per height | `safety::check_no_split_finality()`, TLA+ model |
| **S2: Finality Monotonic** | `finalized_height` never decreases | `safety::check_finality_monotonic()`, TLA+ model |
| **S3: Deterministic PV** | All correct nodes agree on PV(height) | `safety::check_deterministic_pv()`, TLA+ model |
| **S4: State Compatibility** | Old PV not applied after activation | `safety::check_state_compat()`, TLA+ model |
| **M2: Value Conservation** | Token supply conserved across transitions | `safety::check_value_conservation()` |
| **M3: Root Equivalence** | State root unchanged after format migration | `safety::check_root_equivalence()` |

See `formal/upgrade.tla` for the TLA+ model that formally verifies S1-S4.
See `tests/upgrade_sim.rs` for executable conformance tests.

## Security Impact of v27.1.0 Update

### Protocol Versioning

**Threat**: Without protocol versioning, a hard fork could split the network if some nodes run incompatible rules.

**Mitigation**:
- Every block header now carries `protocol_version`.
- Nodes reject blocks with unsupported protocol versions.
- Activation height + grace window allow coordinated upgrades without halting.

**Residual risk**: If operators fail to upgrade before `activation_height + grace_blocks`, their nodes will be forked off. This is by design (safety over liveness for non-upgraded nodes).

### Schema Migrations

**Threat**: Corrupted or partial migrations could leave the node in an inconsistent state.

**Mitigation**:
- Migrations are atomic (write to `.tmp` + rename).
- Each step persists progress to `schema.json` before moving to the next.
- Interrupted migrations resume from the last successful step.
- Backup files (`.bak`) created before destructive changes.
- Future-version guard prevents running old binary on new data.

**Residual risk**: Disk full during migration could leave `.tmp` files. Recovery: delete `.tmp` files, restart.

### Node Metadata

**Threat**: Stale or missing metadata could cause a node to operate under wrong assumptions.

**Mitigation**:
- `node_meta.json` is checked at startup for compatibility.
- Atomic writes prevent partial metadata.

## Secure Upgrade Procedure

1. **Verify binary integrity**:
   ```bash
   sha256sum iona-node-v27.1.0
   # Compare with published hash in release notes
   ```

2. **Backup before upgrade**:
   ```bash
   cp -r ./data/node ./data/node.bak.$(date +%s)
   ```

3. **Verify after upgrade**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:9001/health
   # Check: status=ok, height advancing, peers connected
   ```

4. **Monitor for anomalies**:
   - Unexpected consensus stalls
   - Peer count drops
   - Evidence of double-signing in logs

## Hardening Notes

This project is a prototype consensus node. Before running with real funds or on an open/public network, complete:
- fuzzing for all decode paths (RPC + P2P)
- connection and message DoS protections
- key management (encrypted keys/HSM/KMS)
- upgrade/migration plan + snapshot compatibility guarantees (implemented in v27.1.0, formalized in v27.2.0)
- formal safety verification (TLA+ model in `formal/upgrade.tla`)
- independent security review/audit

## Key Management

### Production Recommendations

1. **Use encrypted keystore** (`keystore = "encrypted"` in config.toml)
2. **Use environment variables** for passwords (never in config files)
3. **Consider remote signer** for validator keys (`signing.mode = "remote"`)
4. **Rotate keys periodically** (coordinate with network governance)
5. **Never commit key files** to version control

### File Permissions

```bash
chmod 600 data/node/keys.json    # or keys.enc
chmod 700 data/node/             # directory
```
